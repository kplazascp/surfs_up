# Surf's up Challenge

## Overview
We have an amazing plan to open the new Surf n´shake shop in Hawaii where we will serve surf boards and ice cream to locals and turists.
Our investor, W.avy has concerns for the weather, this is why we are performing a weather analysis on Oahu, where we will open the shop.

## Results
### June Temperatures

- The average temperature for June is 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius), which is a good temperature for surfers.
- The maximun temperature for June is 85 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), which is great temperature for surfers and for buying ice cream.
- The minimim temperature for June is 64 degrees Fahrenheit (17 degrees Celsius), which is not a bad temperature for surfers, but maybe the ice cream sales go down. 

### December Temperatures

- The average temperature for December is 71 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), which is as good a temperature for surfers in winter as well as in summer.
- The maximun temperature for December is 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius), which is great temperature for surfers and for buying ice cream, as well as in June.
- The minimim temperature for December is 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius), which isa low temperature for surfers, and for buying ice cream.

## Summary
Even though the tempratures for December are lower than the the temperatures from June, there are not significantly different. 
The mean and maximum temperature are very close for both months, the minimum temperature is the one that has the highest difference for December.
This can tell us that the temperatures in the extreme seassons, do not affect as much Oahu as other cities in the word.

For other variable that would make this analysis more complete will be to add the precipitation, even though the temperature is a great variable, it doesn't mean that whenever there is high temperature, it doesn´t rain.
With the precipitation in our analysis, we can be able to get to know better the mean percentage of precipitation for all the months.

Besides this, I believe the amount of data that is being analyzed is not enough. 
We could introduce more data for this two months (temperature and precipitation) as well as forecast of the weather data in the next months/years, so that we can make a more informed decision.
